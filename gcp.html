        <h2>Google Cloud AI Platform</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fully managed platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch and offers tools for data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment
        </p>

        <h2>Google Cloud Vision AI</h2>
        <p>
            This service enables you to analyze images using machine learning. It can be used for tasks like image classification, object detection, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
        </p>

        <h2>Google Cloud Natural Language AI</h2>
        <p>
            It provides tools for text analysis, including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntax analysis. This is useful for understanding and extracting insights from unstructured text data.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech</h2>
        <p>
            These services convert spoken language into written text and vice versa. They are used for applications like transcription services and voice assistants.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Cloud AutoML</h2>
        <p> 
            Google Cloud's AutoML services allow developers to build custom machine learning models with minimal expertise in machine learning. This includes AutoML Vision, AutoML Natural Language, and AutoML Tables.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Cloud AI Building Blocks</h2>
        <p>
            These are pre-trained, customizable models for specific AI tasks, including Document AI (for document processing), Contact Center AI (for customer service), Recommendations AI (for personalized recommendations), and more.
        </p>

        <h2>TensorFlow on Google Cloud</h2>
        <p>
            you can run TensorFlow, an open-source deep learning framework, on Google Cloud for building and training machine learning models.
        </p>

        <h2>BigQuery ML</h2>
        <p>
            Google BigQuery offers machine learning capabilities, allowing you to build models directly within your data warehouse. You can create and train models on large datasets without the need for extensive data movement.
        </p>

        <h2>AI Hub</h2>
        <p>
            This is a repository of reusable AI components and models that can be shared across organizations.
